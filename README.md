# About me
My name is Adam Trojanowski. Im begginer in the world of software testing, who love to test various apps and websites especially using exploratory techniques.
Even though Im a big fan of exploratory testing I also understand importance of more formal techniques.
My goal for now is to gain knowledge about software testing, overall software engineering and finally land a job as a junior QA / manual tester.
On this site I would like to share my all gained experience from personal studies and researches.
